  "content": "# Understanding the Spectrum\n\nThe **waterfall display** and **FFT spectrum** are your primary tools for visualising radio signals. Learning to read them is essential.\n\n## The FFT Spectrum\n\nThe Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) converts time-domain samples into a frequency-domain view. It shows signal strength (dB) across a range of frequencies at one instant.\n\n## The Waterfall\n\nThe waterfall is a scrolling spectrogram:\n- **X-axis:** Frequency\n- **Y-axis:** Time (newest at top)\n- **Colour:** Signal strength (blue=quiet, yellow/red=strong)\n\n## Reading Signals\n\n| Pattern | Signal Type |\n|---------|------------|\n| Wide, constant band | FM broadcast (~200 kHz) |\n| Thin constant line | Carrier/beacon |\n| Intermittent blobs | Voice (push-to-talk) |\n| Uniform rectangle | Digital data |\n| Brief wideband pulse | Radar/burst |\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- **Noise floor:** The background level where no signals exist\n- **SNR:** Signal-to-Noise Ratio — how much a signal rises above the noise\n- **Bandwidth:** How wide a signal is in Hz\n- **Centre frequency:** The middle of your tuned range",

      "content": "Zoom into quieter parts of the spectrum. Many signals are narrow and intermittent — walkie-talkies, pagers, IoT devices. The waterfall's time axis helps you spot brief transmissions."

      "explanation": "The noise floor is the baseline level of random noise. Signals must rise above this floor to be detectable."
