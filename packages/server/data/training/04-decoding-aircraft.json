  "content": "# Decoding Aircraft with ADS-B\n\nADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast) lets you track every aircraft within hundreds of miles using your SDR.\n\n## How It Works\n\nAircraft broadcast their GPS position, altitude, speed, and callsign on **1090 MHz** once per second. These transmissions are unencrypted and freely receivable.\n\n## The Data\n\nEach ADS-B message contains:\n- **ICAO address** — unique aircraft identifier (e.g., 406A3B)\n- **Callsign** — flight number (e.g., BAW256)\n- **Position** — latitude and longitude\n- **Altitude** — in feet (barometric or GPS)\n- **Velocity** — ground speed and heading\n- **Squawk** — transponder code\n\n## Emergency Squawks\n\n| Code | Meaning |\n|------|--------|\n| 7700 | Emergency (Mayday) |\n| 7600 | Radio failure |\n| 7500 | Hijack |\n\n## Antenna Tips\n\nADS-B works best with a vertical antenna tuned for 1090 MHz. A quarter-wave ground plane has elements of 6.9cm. Mount it as high as possible — even a window mount helps dramatically.",
