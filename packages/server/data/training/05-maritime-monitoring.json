  "content": "# Maritime Monitoring with AIS\n\nAIS (Automatic Identification System) is the maritime equivalent of ADS-B. Every large vessel broadcasts its identity, position, course, and speed.\n\n## Frequencies\n\n- **Channel 87B:** 161.975 MHz\n- **Channel 88B:** 162.025 MHz\n\nBoth channels are used simultaneously with TDMA (time-division multiple access).\n\n## What Ships Broadcast\n\n### Every 2-10 seconds (dynamic data):\n- Position (lat/lon)\n- Speed over ground\n- Course over ground\n- Rate of turn\n- Navigation status\n\n### Every 6 minutes (static data):\n- MMSI (9-digit unique ID)\n- Vessel name and callsign\n- Ship type and dimensions\n- Destination and ETA\n\n## AIS Classes\n\n| Class | Who | Update Rate |\n|-------|-----|------------|\n| Class A | Large vessels (>300 GT) | 2-10 seconds |\n| Class B | Pleasure craft | 30s - 3 min |\n| AtoN | Buoys, lighthouses | 3 minutes |\n\n## Reception Tips\n\nCoastal locations are ideal. Even 20-30 miles inland with a good antenna on a mast, you'll receive plenty of maritime traffic. VHF signals travel well over water.",
