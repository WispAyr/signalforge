It proves your entire chain works — antenna, SDR, software, audio.",

      "explanation": "FM broadcast uses ~200 kHz bandwidth, which is why it sounds so much better than narrowband communications."

      "explanation": "2.048 MHz (2 MSPS) is the standard sample rate for RTL-SDR FM reception — wide enough to capture the full signal."
