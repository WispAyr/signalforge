  "content": "# Building Custom Flowgraphs\n\nSignalForge's Flow Editor lets you build custom signal processing chains by connecting blocks together — like a visual programming language for radio.\n\n## Core Block Types\n\n### Sources\n- **SDR Source** — connects to your RTL-SDR or SoapySDR device\n- **File Source** — replay recorded IQ files\n- **WebSDR Source** — stream from remote WebSDR receivers\n\n### Processing\n- **FFT** — frequency analysis (powers the waterfall)\n- **Downconverter** — extract a narrowband signal from wideband IQ\n- **Filter** — low-pass, band-pass, high-pass filtering\n\n### Demodulators\n- **FM Demod** — wide or narrow FM demodulation\n- **AM Demod** — amplitude modulation\n- **SSB Demod** — upper/lower sideband\n\n### Decoders\n- **ADS-B Decoder** — aircraft tracking from 1090 MHz\n- **AIS Decoder** — maritime vessel tracking\n- **APRS Decoder** — amateur radio packet data\n- **POCSAG Decoder** — pager messages\n\n### Outputs\n- **Audio Out** — play through speakers\n- **Waterfall** — visual spectrum display\n- **MQTT Sink** — publish to MQTT broker\n- **File Sink** — record to file\n\n## Building a Flow\n\n1. **Drag blocks** from the palette onto the canvas\n2. **Connect ports** by clicking an output and dragging to an input\n3. **Configure parameters** by clicking a block\n4. **Start** the flow with the play button\n\n## Tips\n\n- Start simple (source → demod → output) and add complexity\n- The SDR Multiplexer lets you run multiple receivers from one SDR\n- Save flows to share with the community\n- Background flows run continuously even when you switch views",
